- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeoGraper
- 👀 I’m interested in Domotica, automating my equipment in my house
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to behave and hold on as my volunteer work is impossible to do right now, maybe soon
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything worth spending time on
- 📫 How to reach me is better left here, I'm pretty cautions in sharing my email etc...
